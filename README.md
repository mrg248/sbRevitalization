South Bend stands at a pivotal moment in its urban development journey. The city, rich in history
and potential, requires a strategic approach to unlock opportunities hidden within its urban
landscape. As advocates for progressive urban development, we present to you a project brief
for a strategic redevelopment initiative that will serve as a catalyst for economic growth and
societal enrichment in South Bend. At the heart of this proposal is a sophisticated geospatial
analysis dashboard designed to facilitate informed decision-making for the city's redevelopment
projects. Working with your office, we want to help transform South Bend into a vibrant,
economically robust, and community-focused city.
