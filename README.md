Subject: Data-Driven Revitalization for South Bend’s Redevelopment Initiative
From: Kevin Gallagher, Nicole McAlee, Carolina SantaMaria, and Siyu Zhu
To: Mayor James Mueller
South Bend stands at a pivotal moment in its urban development journey. The city, rich in history
and potential, requires a strategic approach to unlock opportunities hidden within its urban
landscape. As advocates for progressive urban development, we present to you a project brief
for a strategic redevelopment initiative that will serve as a catalyst for economic growth and
societal enrichment in South Bend. At the heart of this proposal is a sophisticated geospatial
analysis dashboard designed to facilitate informed decision-making for the city's redevelopment
projects. Working with your office, we want to help transform South Bend into a vibrant,
economically robust, and community-focused city.
The primary goals of this initiative are to:
● Provide a comprehensive understanding of the geographic layout of city council districts,
locations of abandoned properties, and businesses. A map serves as the central
element, with color-coded city council districts, for quick and distinct identification of the
city’s administrative divisions. Additionally, the map incorporates interactive features to
enable users to filter and explore locations of abandoned properties and businesses.
The map serves as a powerful tool allowing for the identification of areas in need of
revitalization and for guiding strategic redevelopment efforts.
● Offer a thorough understanding of the city’s population and socioeconomic dynamics.
The inclusion of choropleth maps presents a clear and intuitive method for visualizing
population density and median household income. There is a selection feature that
enables the user to seamlessly switch between these two maps, facilitating the
comparison and analysis of population and income data across various locations in the
city. Ultimately, this aims to provide stakeholders with the knowledge necessary to make
well-informed decisions regarding redevelopment initiatives, specifically tailored to the
diverse needs of different areas within the city.
● Identify key “redevelopment corridors” in each city council district. Redevelopment
corridors are areas with a significant number of abandoned properties that have been
demolished or deconstructed, which are now ready to be rebuilt into new housing stock,
businesses, retail storefronts, or restaurants. Users can select a city council district from
a drop-down list and visualize these redevelopment corridors with stacked bar charts,
colored by zip code. Stakeholders can identify the streets in most need of redevelopment
and the appropriate councilperson to partner with to address these needs.
● Ground the redevelopment plan in a deep understanding of the economic conditions in
each city council district in order to target areas that would benefit most from the
development of new housing, businesses, retail, and restaurants, while avoiding the
economic exclusion and displacement of current residents. Using a series of
checkboxes, a user can overlay boxplots of median income information from different
city council districts over each other, allowing a comparison of districts against each
other.
This intuitive dashboard has been designed to cater to the needs of stakeholders including:
● City Officials and Planners: who require a top down view of South Bend's potential.
● Local Business Owners: who can identify opportunities for expansion or enhance their
existing operations.
● Community Leaders: who understand how redevelopment can benefit their districts.
● Investors and Developers: who need insights to inform their investment decisions
including community and council district boundaries.
Through the use of data and innovative tools like the proposed dashboard, South Bend can set
itself on a path to becoming a model city that merges tradition with progress and vision with
action. We are eager to discuss this project further with you and explore how we can turn these
insights into impactful actions. Thank you for considering this proposal. We are confident that
together we can chart a new course for South Bend's growth and prosperity
